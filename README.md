# Reactive iOS Movies

This app will show you the last top movies released by using the itunes RSS feed.

This app was coded using [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and structured under the Model View View-Model ([MVVVM](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848246.aspx)) pattern.

You can watch a introducction to this two concepts thanks to Realm [here](https://realm.io/news/slug-max-alexander-mvvm-rxswift/).
